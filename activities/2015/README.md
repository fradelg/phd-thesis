# Research activities along 2005

This is the second chapter of my research diary. This chapter is specially suited for my research activities along 2015.

In 2015, and according to my initial PhD schedule, I hope to be able to implement the first prototype to recover dense triangular meshes from the monocular video input from a conventional HD webcam.
