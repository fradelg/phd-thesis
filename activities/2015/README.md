# Research activities along 2015

This is the second chapter of my research diary which describes the research tasks developed along my second year of PhD (2015). This chapter is composed by one section per month of work, trying to summarize the work at the each week.

The year begins with the fulfillment of the two reports required by my University to renew my grant one more year. In the next 12 months I hope to be able of completing the barebones of my framework for 3D real-time reconstruction including the state of the art of some stereo matching methods. However there is still another two years to complete my research so it is expected that results won't be as good as it could be. According to my initial PhD schedule, I have to implement the first prototype to recover dense triangular meshes from the monocular video input from a conventional HD webcam.
