# Research activities along 2015

This is the second chapter of my research diary. This chapter of the book describes the research tasks developed in my PhD along the year 2015. As the other years, this chapter is composed by one section per month of work which summarizes the work done that week.

The year 2015 begins with the fulfillment of the two reports required by my University to renew my grant for one more year. In this year I hope to complete the barebones of my framework for 3D real-time reconstruction at the same time I advance in the improvement of the state of the art stereo matching methods. However there is still another two years to complete my research so it is expected that results won't be as good as it would have to be.
# Research activities along 2005

According to my initial PhD schedule, I hope to be able to implement the first prototype to recover dense triangular meshes from the monocular video input from a conventional HD webcam.
