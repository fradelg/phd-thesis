# Research activities along 2014

This chapter summarizes the research activities performed for my PhD along the year 2014. The documentation is divided by months to ease its readability. Each month is separated by weeks too, without too much details about the specific days or the order of the activities. The theoretical background will be included in the following sections.

I have been awarded with a research grant from University of Valladolid to accomplish my PhD studies starting from March. I want to acknowledge to the University of Valladolid and my advisors for encourage me to continue my research along the past years.
