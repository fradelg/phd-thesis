November
========

1st week
--------

-   Preparing some posters and other graphic materials to expose in
    [AR&PA
    2014](http://www.jcyl.es/web/jcyl/ARPA/es/Plantilla66y33/1267295103271/_/_/_)
    (to be held in two weeks)
-   Studying the interesting solution for colume cost computation using
    octrees from @Steinbr2014 titled "Volumetric 3D Mapping in Real-Time
    on a CPU"

2nd week
--------

-   My third (and last) class of OpenCV with Python. Unfortunatley,
    there is no time to explain segmentation examples which are not
    necessary to complete the practice.
-   Writing the formal statement of the OpenCV practices for the
    students
-   Assisting to AR&PA 2014. I meet very interesting works in the fields
    of mobile mapping (based on LIDAR devices and spherical panoramas)
    and real time rendering of previously reconstructed scenes using
    multiples views. The reference product in the segment of
    photogrammetry is Agisoft PhotoScan

3rd week
--------

-   Augmenting the framework to include scene updating and maintenance
    in separate threads. The same idea has been used previosly in the
    PTAM implementation
-   Compiling and testing the Open Source alternative to PhotoScan,
    called [MicMac](http://logiciels.ign.fr/?-Micmac,3-), a project from
    the IGN Francaise. It is a good alternative but it is not good as
    PhotoScan, specially in regard to the image calibration step.

4rd week
--------

-   Collaborating with my lab partners in writing and reviewing the
    extended abstract for 3D ARCH 2015 titled: "AUGMENTED REALITY TO
    PRESERVE HIDDEN VESTIGES IN HISTORICAL CITIES. A CASE STUDY"
-   Installing and setting a [ShareLatex](https://github.com/sharelatex)
    environment to allow collaborative editing in our own server
    following the ISPRS guidelines for authors.
-   Reviewing slides related with my PhD work for the next meeting of
    the Asturian Cluster of Digital Contents in Gijon (thursday and
    friday)
