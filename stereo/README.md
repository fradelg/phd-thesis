# Stereo Matching

Stereo matching is the process which computes a depth map from two images with a significant overlap. The camera calibration (intrinsic and extrinsic) is assumed as previously known. A stereo matching step is mandatory to achieve a 3D dense reconstruction since the epipolar lines are taken into account to extract full or semi dense dense maps.

Between the several 3D dense stereo algorithms ...
