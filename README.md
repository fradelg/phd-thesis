# Real Time Monocular 3D Reconstruction

This book summarizes the knowledge acquired along the development activities performed during my PhD research. It is written in Markdown language extended with citation support from Pandoc. The idea is that it could serve as a diary of activities or a progress report.

3D reconstruction from a single video stream (monocular camera) recover the depth of scene objects using information from consecutive frames. Our research aims to improve the accuracy and performance of the overall process introducing a feedback between the reconstruction and recognition phases.

At a first step, the research is focused only on interior scenes with closed loops using triangulation between different camera positions at a graph. Energy minimization techniques will be applied when possible

Results could be applied to medicine, architecture, forestry, robotics or audiovisual production, among others.
